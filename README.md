This repository is for the 2025 M2R project, which we have done on Bayesian Inference for the inference of Cancer Evolution.

Specifically, our project is "Bayesian Inference for reducing computational load in recovering cancer evolution from DNAÂ methylation".
In this repository, you'll find the Stan model we used to define the frechet distributions that approximate each peak of the DNA methylation graph, as well as the python code to run Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling on the Stan Model to make inferences about relevant parameters.
This project was influenced by the EVOFLUx manuscript by Gabbutt et al.
